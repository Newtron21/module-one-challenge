# Module One challenge

## Description

-My motivation was to build a website that met Userstory, accpetance criteria and learn HTML and CSS.

-I built this project to help this webpage meet userstory and to learn more about css and html.

-It solved the problem of making sure the accessibility was up to standard and got rid of all div elements so it was all semantic html code.

-I learned how to make it all semantic html code, check css, assign attributes, build the page correctly.
